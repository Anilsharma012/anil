        <h2 className="CUET-h2">What is CUET?</h2>
        <p className="CUET-p">
          CUET stands for Common University Entrance Test and is a combination of various tests
          conducted by NTA (National testing Agency) for admission into various Undergraduate and
          Post Graduate Programmes of a major number of central universities, deemed and state
          universities along with some private colleges. So, if one wishes to pursue Humanities or
          Commerce or Science as specialization for their UG, then one needs to appear for CUET and
          score impressively to get into the best of universities. CUET is a primarily a game of
          various combinations of subjects and tests and evaluates the overall academic development
          of a candidate. It is a common platform provided to the students where they can showcase
          their academic, logical and linguistic prowess to the institutions which will eventually
          help them to choose the right candidates for their courses.

        <h2 className="CUET-h2">Why CUET?</h2>
        <p className="CUET-p">
          The primary aim of the New Education Policy is to equip young people with the knowledge
          and skills necessary to confidently lead the country into the future by putting a strong
          emphasis on holistic development, flexible and multidisciplinary education, technological
          integration, and inclusive practices. In this regard CUET, is a step to revolutionize the
          higher education system in which a student can get to his desired college and course by
          taking a single test instead of multiple entrance tests of varied difficulty. CUET aims to
          provide a common platform to students of diverse educational backgrounds and gives a
          comprehensive evaluation system to the colleges to assess a studentâ€™s subject knowledge
          and its application, skills, logical abilities and linguistic skills.

      <section className="CUET-section">
        <h2 className="CUET-h2">Why should students take CUET exam?</h2>
        <p className="CUET-p">
          As we have already noted that a majority of universitiesâ€”be it Central, State, deemed or
          privateâ€”take up CUET scores for admission into their UG and PG courses. So, it becomes
          quite obvious for the students to appear for CUET and get into the coveted universities.
          Now, CUET also offers a great advantage to the students. It levels the playing field and
          gives equal opportunities to all the students to perform at equal capabilities in a common
          entrance test irrespective of their academic scores in X and XII. For example, Delhi
          University used to take admission into their courses and colleges based on the XII
          standard scores and if any candidate had low scores in XII, then he/she would have no
          chance of studying from DU. As students come from different backgrounds, schools and
          boards and each of them have a different reputation of allocating scores to the students,
          there was a high probability of even the meritorious students getting low scores. But now
          thanks to CUET, even those with mediocre scores in XII can dream to pursue UG courses from
          the coveted DU colleges. So, appearing for CUET is a must for all the reputed UG and PG
          courses offered by some of the most sought-after universities.
